Create an application where you can switch traffic lights. At the first start, the color of each traffic light signal must be turned off.

By pressing the button «START» the red light should light up, and the title of the button should change its value to «NEXT». The subsequent pressing of the «NEXT» button should change the active color to the next in order. Thus, each subsequent push of the "Next" button should change the traffic light signals in sequence.

The lights should be round. Interface elements should be visible on any available screen.
